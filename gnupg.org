** GPG: Extract private key and import on different machine

   Copied verbatim from [[https://makandracards.com/makandra/37763-gpg-extract-private-key-and-import-on-different-machine][here]].

   - Identify your private key by running gpg --list-secret-keys. You need the
     ID of your private key (second column)

   - Run this command to export your key:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     gpg --export-secret-keys $ID > my-private-key.asc
     #+END_SRC

   - Copy the key to the other machine (scp is your friend)

   - To import the key, run gpg --import my-private-key.asc

   - If the key already existed on the second machine, the import will fail
     saying 'Key already known'. You will have to delete both the private and
     public key first (gpg --delete-keys and gpg --delete-secret-keys)
